# CHANGELOG

## [0.1.1] 
### general
Since this is the start of the project on git, it is very possible that I missed some things. This process of changelogs will improve now that we use git.
- changed the XP curve to be significantly less grindy (thx panbanan)
- I added a lot of stuff from the last AP beta version, this might cause issues (expect weird quests, advancements, stuff might not work)
- will update origins with custom ones soon, until then enjoy the standard ones
- some mods got added to test them, others won't have immediate effects but are needed for planned stuff
- backslot and backslot scale increased because anime
### fixes
- villagers should be back to normal
- other dimensions should now have mobs following the level rules
